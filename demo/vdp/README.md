## Vector Dot Product (VDP)

In this demo, we will show how to compute the dot product of two vectors `N` element vectors `A` from Alice and `B` from Bob through the TinyGarble framework.
The VDP `Y` of `A` and `B` is computed through a sequence of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations as shown by the following equation

![Y = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}A_iB_i](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D0%7D%5E%7BN-1%7DA_iB_i)

We will follow the steps presented in the [start page](/README.md) to compute this equation.
